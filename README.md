## Some draft.....
German assimilation game (sorting trash/ fighting german neighbours/ a maze leading to the Rathaus and the documents are the boosters, enemy is the bahnhof enjoyers and the DB delays) - different cities as different levels (1. Munich, 2. Heilbronn 3.Berlin 4. Frankfurt) (random DB cancellation force the player to restart level)
Finding luggage at the airport while racing against time (before the train leaves) (
Dynamic obstacles - cars/horse/ trolley/ german neighbour/ smoking teenagers/ a bear (in berlin) a golden lion (munich)   etc / train controller reappearing - will take away one ticket. Once all 5 tickets are taken away then restart level  (or maybe the player has to collect his Deutschlandticket first at the levels where there are ticket guys) (maybe there’s a chance of your ticket not working?)
Boostups - pretzel/Apfelschorle/Currywurst/Döner
Collectable lives: health insurance card?
Could also implement hunger (and goal is to collect the food before hunger level <0)
Collectable power-ups : beer/ wurstbrotchen/ protection from ticket guy for 30 seconds/ fake ticket/ Pfand bottles (return them to supermarket and you get bonus points)
Key - documents that can be collected at the Burgeramt to unlock next level/ train ticket/ health insurance/
bank account/ permanent residence
Traps - glass bottles / Baustelle forces you to reroute
Requirements: enemies and boostups
tum : finding etze
Grocery shopping idea
